ATM Coding Challange

The set up is pretty simple, just run the pin.html.
I dont have much exposure to using API's, I have only ever used very simple Facebook, Twitter or Yahoo weather API's so I am unsure of how to get the users pin from the API and check the balance. Instead I set the pin and users balance in the sessionStorage of the browser so the users balance should continue to update until you logout and navigate back to the pin screen at which stage the users balance will again be set to Â£220. I could have used localStorage to ensure the balance stays the same when the user logs out however I though that would possibly make things more difficult for testing etc.

Despite the parts of the challange I was unable to complete, I hope my attempt shows some initiative and an ability to problem solve and come up with a solutions.

Also, appologies for the delay but I have been very sick the the last week.

Cheers,

Andi
